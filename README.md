My personal uBlock filter that removes fandom.com, AI search overviews, and prominent AI sites from google and image search. 

For easy import in uBlockOrigin, simply paste [this link](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bensouth22/uBlockOrigin-Slop-Filter@main/slop%20filter.txt) in the text box at the bottom of the **"Filter Lists"** tab.
